This module performs abstractions for the CXI detector stands in order to
manipulate them as rigid bodies. By first manipulating pairs of motors as
joints, and then the stand as a collection of three unieque joints, higher
level functions such as translate and rotate are created to help the operator
quickly adjust the stand.
