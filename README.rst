This module performs abstractions for the CXI detector stands in order to
manipulate them as rigid bodies. By first manipulating pairs of motors as
joints, and then the stand as a collection of three unieque joints, higher
level functions such as translate and rotate are created to help the operator
quickly adjust the stand. The original code base that this package expands on
can be found on the `SLAC Confluence Page
<https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/CXI+Coordinated+Motion>`_.
